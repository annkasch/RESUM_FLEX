## Interchangeable models

CNP, MLP, tabular transformer and BDT now share `core.surrogates` for building,
fitting, prediction, evaluation, checkpointing and MFGP preparation.
See [the component API and migration guide](docs/surrogates.md).

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 \
  .venv/bin/python -m core.surrogates train config.optical.resum.yaml
```

The only retained run config is `config.optical.resum.yaml`, for the full optical
CNP → MFGP pipeline. Model alternatives are documented in the component guide.

For the complete optical CNP → MFGP pipeline, use `config.optical.resum.yaml`
with the same command. See [data preparation and training](docs/surrogates.md).
Experimental BDT/MLP/transformer notebooks and standalone runners have been
removed; use this shared entry point for model comparisons.

Raw input folder lists are configured in [config.optical.data.yaml](config.optical.data.yaml).
The training configuration points to the resulting prepared dataset.

For one maintained notebook covering the full LAr optical-map workflow, open
[notebooks/lar_optical_map.ipynb](notebooks/lar_optical_map.ipynb).
Run All trains a fresh CNP and MFGP; set `RUN_TRAINING = False` to inspect a saved run.

# RESUM_FLEX

A modular refactor of **RESuM** (Rare Event Surrogate Model) — a physics-ML
pipeline for **Rare Event Design (RED)** problems where the design metric
`y = m/N` is a discrete count with high variance. The framework denoises
binary observations with a Conditional Neural Process (CNP), then fuses
multi-fidelity scores with a Multi-Fidelity Gaussian Process (MFGP), and
selects new design points by Integrated Variance Reduction (IVR) or
Expected Improvement (EI).

Reference paper: [RESuM: A Rare Event Surrogate Model](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=lqTILjL6lP).

## Install

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd RESUM_FLEX

uv sync --extra gp                 # locked NumPy 2 + GP + dev environment
uv run pytest -q
```

Python 3.11–3.12 is supported; `.python-version` selects 3.12 for local
development. PyTorch is a hard dependency. The `gp` extra installs
`GPy>=1.14.2` and `emukit>=0.5.1` for MFGP / Phase 4 & 5. Test and lint tools
live in the non-published `dev` dependency group and are installed by default.

The legacy `gp-numpy1` extra pins its own NumPy and SciPy compatibility bounds
and is used by the NumPy 1 compatibility job. This split is required rather
than cosmetic: GPy 1.14.2 depends on
`paramz>=0.10`, which in turn requires NumPy 2, while GPy 1.13.2 belongs to
the older NumPy 1 stack. The extras and NumPy groups are declared mutually
exclusive, so uv rejects invalid combinations instead of silently mixing them.

The uv development lock selects the portable CPU-only PyTorch wheel. This is a
development source override only: the published package metadata remains
backend-neutral, so downstream users can select CPU, CUDA, ROCm, or another
appropriate PyTorch build.

The compatibility matrix pins Torch 2.11.0 in the development group so the
NumPy 1/2 comparison does not also change the neural-network implementation.
This exact pin is not part of the published package requirements.

### Pixi + uv: complementary ownership

`pyproject.toml` is the **only** declaration of Python package requirements,
and `uv.lock` is the **only** Python dependency lock. `pixi.toml` deliberately
contains only the `uv` executable plus task definitions; `pixi.lock` therefore
reproduces the outer tool layer without independently resolving the Python
stack.

```text
pixi.toml / pixi.lock       pyproject.toml / uv.lock
        │                              │
        └── pins and runs uv ──────────┴── resolves Python packages
```

After installing Pixi, the common commands are:

```bash
pixi run sync               # materialize .venv-numpy2 from uv.lock
pixi run test               # default NumPy 2 test suite
pixi run test-numpy1        # independent .venv-numpy1 compatibility suite
pixi run test-all           # both locked compatibility environments
pixi run numpy2-check       # NumPy 2 removed/deprecated API scan
pixi run lock-check         # fail if pyproject.toml and uv.lock diverge
```

All Pixi tasks invoke uv with `--frozen`; Pixi never installs Python packages
into its own environment. The two NumPy variants use separate virtualenvs, so
switching compatibility tests cannot mutate the other environment. The NumPy 2
test task fixes BLAS to one thread because its OpenBLAS build otherwise creates
dozens of workers for small GP matrices. The legacy NumPy 1 task fixes two
threads to preserve its existing deterministic optimization path.

### Paper aggregate replay

`notebooks/paper_2410_03873_reproduction.ipynb` replays the portions of the
RESuM paper that are supported by the aggregate artifacts in the original
repository. It covers the stored CNP diagnostics, all six recorded
active-learning updates, the three-fidelity MFGP, the 100-trial HF validation,
and the no-CNP ablation. The notebook labels aggregate replay separately from
exact recomputation and leaves one intentionally empty CNP cell because the
complete portable event corpus and current checkpoint are unavailable.

The aggregate inputs and their provenance are bundled under
`notebooks/data/paper_2410_03873/`, so the notebook does not import or read from
the original RESuM checkout:

```bash
pixi run notebook
```

The `notebook` dependency group supplies JupyterLab without publishing it as a
runtime library requirement. Pixi delegates that group to uv and materializes
it in an isolated `.venv-notebook` environment, preserving the same ownership
boundary as the test environments. The current replay reads CSV files only and
therefore does not require `h5py`.

### NumPy compatibility contract

The library declares `numpy>=1.24,<3`; uv's mutually exclusive `numpy1` and
`numpy2` groups test both sides of that range. NumPy 2 support also requires
the compatible lower bounds on compiled or NumPy-facing dependencies:

| Dependency | Declared minimum | NumPy 2 status in this project |
|---|---:|---|
| SciPy | 1.13 in `numpy2` | First SciPy release targeting NumPy 2; legacy group uses ≤1.12 |
| Matplotlib | 3.9 | Wheels are built against the NumPy 2-compatible ABI |
| PyTorch | 2.3 | NumPy bridge support; round-trip covered by a test |
| GPy | 1.14.2 | NumPy 2 compatibility release; requires paramz 0.10+ |
| Emukit | 0.5.1 | Core NumPy 2 support and current GPy integration |
| Pydantic / PyYAML | unchanged | No NumPy ABI dependency |

Run `pixi run numpy2-check` for Ruff's NumPy 2 migration rule (`NPY201`). Full
tests, including GPy fit/predict, MFGP coverage, optimizer behavior, and the
Torch↔NumPy boundary, run in both locked environments. The NumPy 1 job uses
the explicitly isolated `gp-numpy1` legacy extra.

**Decoupling rule:** PyTorch lives only in `core/networks.py`,
`core/surrogate_cnp.py`, `core/training.py`, and `core/optimizer.py`. The
schema layer is numpy-native; `core/surrogate_mfgp.py` (GPy/Emukit) consumes
those arrays directly. `core/mfgp_pipeline.py` is the only file where
torch and GPy coexist — and only at the boundary (CNP → numpy → GP).

---

## I/O schemas

Everything the package consumes or emits is one of these typed objects.
All array fields are `numpy.ndarray`.

### Input — `StandardBatch`

The primary pipeline carrier. Three modalities are supported via the `mode` flag:

| `mode` (`InputMode`) | `theta` | `phi` | `labels` (X) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `InputMode.FULL` | `[B, D_θ]` | `[B, N, D_φ]` | `[B, N]` binary {0,1} |
| `InputMode.EVENT_ONLY` | `None` | `[B, N, D_φ]` | `[B, N]` binary |
| `InputMode.DESIGN_ONLY` | `[B, D_θ]` | `None` | `[B, N]` binary |

`B` = number of trials; `N` = events per trial; `D_θ`, `D_φ` ≥ 1 (arbitrary).
Optional field `beta: [B, N] ∈ [0, 1]` is filled by the CNP.

```python
from schemas.data_models import StandardBatch, InputMode
batch = StandardBatch(
    mode=InputMode.FULL,
    theta=theta_arr,        # (B, D_θ)
    phi=phi_arr,            # (B, N, D_φ)
    labels=labels_arr,      # (B, N), values in {0, 1}
)
```

The validator cross-checks `mode` against the presence of `theta` / `phi`
and verifies all batch dims agree, so malformed batches fail at construction.

### Output — `ModelPrediction`

What MFGP-style models return at query points:

| Field | Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `mean` | `[B]` | Posterior mean μ(θ) |
| `variance` | `[B]` | Posterior variance σ²(θ) (≥ 0) |
| `theta_query` | `[B, D_θ]` | The θ values queried |

Available via `MultiFidelityGP.predict_as_model_prediction(X)`.

### Output — `cnp_trial_predictive` dict

Per-trial predictive distribution from a trained CNP. All values are 1-D arrays of length `B` (number of trials):

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `y_cnp` | Posterior mean of `y = m/N` on the trial |
| `sigma_total` | √(σ²_epistemic + σ²_aleatoric) |
| `sigma_epistemic` | CNP-decoder uncertainty (model knowledge) |
| `sigma_aleatoric` | √(p(1-p)/N) — irreducible Bernoulli noise |

### Output — MFGP datasets dict

Returned by `prepare_mfgp_datasets_from_batches`. Each entry is `(n_trials, k)` numpy:

| Key | Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `X_lf` | `(n_lf, D_θ)` | Per-trial θ for the LF dataset |
| `Y_lf_cnp` | `(n_lf, 1)` | β̄(θ) per LF trial (CNP-aggregated) |
| `X_hf` | `(n_hf, D_θ)` | Per-trial θ for the HF dataset |
| `Y_hf_cnp` | `(n_hf, 1)` | β̄(θ) per HF trial |
| `Y_hf_raw` | `(n_hf, 1)` | `m/N` per HF trial — the GP's target signal |

### Output — coverage dict

Returned by `evaluate_mfgp_coverage_from_batch`:

| Key | Shape / Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `theta` | `(n_test, D_θ)` | Held-out θ |
| `y_obs` | `(n_test,)` | Observed `m/N` per trial |
| `mu` | `(n_test,)` | MFGP posterior mean |
| `sigma` | `(n_test,)` | MFGP posterior std |
| `1sigma` / `2sigma` / `3sigma` | float | Fraction inside ±kσ band |

Target Gaussian rates: 68.27 / 95.45 / 99.73 %.

## Configuration

The retained run configuration is **`config.optical.resum.yaml`**. It uses the
shared schema in `schemas/surrogates.py` and runs CNP training followed by MFGP.

```python
from schemas.surrogates import load_surrogate_config
cfg = load_surrogate_config("config.optical.resum.yaml")
print(cfg.training.learning_rate)
```

Legacy APIs still accept their typed configurations, constructed in code:

### Build legacy configs in code

```python
from schemas.config import EncoderConfig, CNPConfig, TrainingConfig

enc_cfg = EncoderConfig(type="mlp", latent_dim=64, hidden_dims=[128, 128], dropout=0.0)
cnp_cfg = CNPConfig(n_context_min=16, n_context_max=64,
                    objective="theory-truth")
train_cfg = TrainingConfig(n_steps=1500, learning_rate=1.0e-3, batch_size=16,
                           n_events_per_trial=128, seed=0)
```

### Override a single field

Validate updates through the shared training schema:

```python
from schemas.surrogates import NeuralTraining
cfg = load_surrogate_config("config.optical.resum.yaml")
custom_train = NeuralTraining.model_validate({
    **cfg.training.model_dump(), "n_steps": 3000, "learning_rate": 5e-4,
})
```

Pass `custom_train` to the shared model's `fit` method.

---

## Usage

The user-facing flow is the **bring-your-own-data** path. The synthetic
generator (`for_scenario("S1"..."S8")`) is for validation / unit tests.

### 1. Prepare your data → `StandardBatch`

The package consumes `StandardBatch` objects. Load your simulation data
(HDF5, npz, CSV, ROOT, …) into numpy arrays, then instantiate:

```python
import numpy as np
from schemas.data_models import StandardBatch, InputMode

# Example: load from your file format
arrays = np.load("my_lf_simulation.npz")
theta_lf  = arrays["theta"]      # shape (n_trials, D_θ)
phi_lf    = arrays["phi"]        # shape (n_trials, n_events_per_trial, D_φ)
labels_lf = arrays["X"]          # shape (n_trials, n_events_per_trial), {0, 1}

lf_batch = StandardBatch(
    mode=InputMode.FULL,
    theta=theta_lf,
    phi=phi_lf,
    labels=labels_lf.astype(np.int8),
)
```

For event-only or design-only modalities, set the absent component to
`None` and use the matching `InputMode`:

```python
event_only = StandardBatch(mode=InputMode.EVENT_ONLY, theta=None, phi=phi, labels=X)
design_only = StandardBatch(mode=InputMode.DESIGN_ONLY, theta=theta, phi=None, labels=X)
```

The validator throws on shape / mode mismatches at construction time.

#### Normalize before you build the batch (important)

The CNP encoder is an MLP that fits the **raw numerical input**. When
`θ` (or `φ`) components have ranges that differ by ≥ ~10× — *whatever
the units* — gradient imbalance makes the encoder *scale-blind*: it
locks onto the high-magnitude dimension and ignores the small one
(often by a factor of 100× in effective gradient flow, even after
long training). The MFGP can compensate via ARD lengthscales; the
CNP cannot.

**Always normalize before building the batch when feature ranges
differ.** Use `core.MinMaxScaler` and persist it alongside your CNP /
MFGP checkpoint so predictions can be inverse-transformed back to the
original units later. **Any numerical ranges are supported** — the
scaler simply maps each feature's `[low, high]` linearly onto
`[-1, 1]` (or any target interval you choose).

Three equivalent ways to construct it:

```python
from core import MinMaxScaler

# 1. Preferred — known per-feature bounds (any numerical ranges).
theta_scaler = MinMaxScaler.from_bounds(
    low=theta_low,             # 1-D array of length D_θ
    high=theta_high,            # 1-D array of length D_θ
)

# 2. Fit from data when bounds aren't known a priori.
theta_scaler = MinMaxScaler.fit(theta_train)

# 3. Pick a different output interval (default is [-1, 1]).
theta_scaler = MinMaxScaler.from_bounds(
    low=theta_low, high=theta_high,
    target_low=0.0, target_high=1.0,
)
```

Concrete examples — the same call works for any ranges:

```python
# Physical units that span vastly different magnitudes:
sc = MinMaxScaler.from_bounds(low=[500.0, 0.0],   high=[3000.0, 1.0])

# Negative ranges, mixed scales:
sc = MinMaxScaler.from_bounds(low=[-50, 1e-6],    high=[50, 1e3])

# 4-D design space:
sc = MinMaxScaler.from_bounds(low=[0, 0, 0, -π],  high=[10, 100, 1, π])
```

Apply, build the batch, train, predict, invert:

```python
theta_scaled = theta_scaler.transform(theta_raw)            # forward
lf_batch = StandardBatch(mode=InputMode.FULL,
                          theta=theta_scaled,
                          phi=phi_lf,                        # use a separate scaler
                          labels=labels_lf.astype(np.int8))   #   for φ if needed

# At predict time, scale the query with the *same* scaler:
mu, var = mfgp.predict(theta_scaler.transform(theta_query_raw))

# Inverse-transform any θ-shaped output (e.g. an AL record) back to original units:
theta_next_raw = theta_scaler.inverse_transform(record.theta_next.reshape(1, -1))[0]
```

If you skip normalization on imbalanced inputs, the framework emits a
`ScaleImbalanceWarning` at `StandardBatch` construction. The threshold
is a 10× per-feature range gap — see `schemas.data_models.SCALE_IMBALANCE_THRESHOLD`.

### 2. Train the CNP

`train_cnp` consumes a duck-typed *batch generator* — anything with the
shape

```python
class HasGenerate:
    mode: InputMode
    dim_theta: int | None
    dim_phi:   int | None
    def generate(self, n_trials: int, n_events: int, seed: int) -> StandardBatch: ...
```

For synthetic data this is `PseudoDataGenerator`. For an in-memory real
dataset, use the supplied `FixedBatchSource` adapter:

```python
from data import FixedBatchSource

sampler = FixedBatchSource(full_lf_batch)
```

Then:

```python
import torch
from core import build_cnp, train_cnp, save_checkpoint
from schemas.config import EncoderConfig, CNPConfig, TrainingConfig

torch.manual_seed(0)
enc_cfg = EncoderConfig(type="mlp", latent_dim=32, hidden_dims=[64, 64], dropout=0.0)
cnp = build_cnp(enc_cfg, dim_theta=sampler.dim_theta, dim_phi=sampler.dim_phi)

history = train_cnp(
    cnp, sampler,
    cnp_config=CNPConfig(n_context_min=32, n_context_max=96,
                         objective="theory-truth"),
    training_config=TrainingConfig(
        n_steps=1500, learning_rate=1e-3,
        batch_size=16, n_events_per_trial=128,
        eval_every=0,                    # ← 0 for real data; see note below
        seed=0,
    ),
)

save_checkpoint("results/cnp.ckpt", cnp,
                encoder_config=enc_cfg,
                dim_theta=sampler.dim_theta, dim_phi=sampler.dim_phi,
                history=history, metadata={"data": "my_simulation_v1"})
```

**Note on `eval_every`:** the in-loop MAE evaluation compares predicted
`β` against analytical `p` from `generator.truth`. Synthetic data has
that; real data does not. Set `eval_every=0` to disable it on real data,
and run your own held-out evaluation (Section 3 / 5) after training.

#### Two truth objectives

Both objectives first apply the logistic-normal moment approximation used by
RESuM. For raw decoder outputs `(μ, s_raw)`:

```text
s     = 0.1 + 0.9 softplus(s_raw)
d     = sqrt(1 + 3 s² / π²)
p̄     = sigmoid(μ / d)
v     = p̄(1-p̄)(1-1/d)
s̄     = softplus(v) + ε
```

`objective="theory-truth"` is the default and follows the probability model:

```text
L_theory = -mean[X log p̄ + (1-X) log(1-p̄)]
```

For binary `X`, this is `-⁠log ∫ Bernoulli(X | p) q(p) dp`, because the
Bernoulli likelihood is linear in `p` and therefore depends on `q` through
`E[p]=p̄`. Use this when `β` is meant to estimate the physical event
probability.

`objective="practice-truth"` reproduces what the legacy Python code actually
executed:

```text
L_practice = -mean[log Normal(X | p̄, s̄)]
```

This treats `{0,1}` observations as points under a continuous Normal density.
It is retained for historical reproducibility, but it is not a Bernoulli
likelihood and can behave differently in rare-event regimes. Loss values from
the two objectives are not directly comparable.

The predicted mean `β=p̄` is shared by both interfaces and remains bounded to
`[0,1]`. The aggregator collapses the **event axis only**.

### 3. CNP-only coverage check (no MFGP)

For pipelines without a fidelity tier (or as a sanity check before MFGP):

```python
from core import cnp_trial_predictive, split_context_target
from viz import plot_coverage_test

# Held-out HF batch
holdout = StandardBatch(mode=InputMode.FULL, theta=hf_theta_test,
                        phi=hf_phi_test, labels=hf_X_test.astype(np.int8))
ctx, tgt = split_context_target(holdout, n_context=64, seed=0)

pred  = cnp_trial_predictive(cnp, ctx, tgt, n_mc_samples=200)
y_raw = tgt.labels.mean(axis=1).astype(float)

coverage = plot_coverage_test(
    y_raw=y_raw,
    y_predicted=pred["y_cnp"],
    sigma_predicted=pred["sigma_total"],
    out_path="results/plots/cnp_only_coverage.png",
    title="CNP-only coverage on held-out HF",
)
print(coverage)  # {"1sigma": 0.68, "2sigma": 0.96, "3sigma": 1.00}
```

### 4. Fit the MFGP on your LF + HF data

```python
from core import (
    prepare_mfgp_datasets_from_batches,
    fit_mfgp_three_fidelity,
    save_mfgp,
)

lf_batch = StandardBatch(mode=InputMode.FULL, theta=lf_theta, phi=lf_phi,
                         labels=lf_X.astype(np.int8))
hf_batch = StandardBatch(mode=InputMode.FULL, theta=hf_theta, phi=hf_phi,
                         labels=hf_X.astype(np.int8))

# Aggregate β̄ via the CNP for both fidelities; collect y_raw = m/N for HF.
data = prepare_mfgp_datasets_from_batches(cnp, lf_batch, hf_batch,
                                           n_mc_samples=50, seed=0)

# Fit the 3-fidelity MFGP (LF β̄, HF β̄, HF y_raw).
mfgp = fit_mfgp_three_fidelity(data, config=cfg.mfgp, n_restarts=5)

save_mfgp("results/mfgp.pkl", mfgp)        # pickle-backed
```

**Predict** at any θ:

```python
import numpy as np
theta_query = np.array([[0.1], [0.2], [0.3]])         # (n, D_θ)
mu, var = mfgp.predict(theta_query)                    # 1-D arrays of length n
# Or get the typed schema:
prediction = mfgp.predict_as_model_prediction(theta_query)
print(prediction.mean, prediction.variance, prediction.theta_query.shape)
```

### 5. Held-out MFGP coverage check

```python
from core import evaluate_mfgp_coverage_from_batch

holdout_batch = StandardBatch(mode=InputMode.FULL, theta=test_theta,
                               phi=test_phi, labels=test_X.astype(np.int8))

result = evaluate_mfgp_coverage_from_batch(mfgp, cnp, holdout_batch, seed=0)

print(f"1σ coverage: {result['1sigma']:.1%}  (target 68.3%)")
print(f"2σ coverage: {result['2sigma']:.1%}  (target 95.5%)")
print(f"3σ coverage: {result['3sigma']:.1%}  (target 99.7%)")

# Plot it the same way as the CNP-only path:
from viz import plot_coverage_test
plot_coverage_test(
    y_raw=result["y_obs"],
    y_predicted=result["mu"],
    sigma_predicted=result["sigma"],
    out_path="results/plots/mfgp_coverage.png",
    title="MFGP coverage on held-out HF",
)
```

### 6. Active learning — IVR (exploration) or EI (exploitation)

Once the MFGP is fit, run an active-learning loop to pick the next θ
to simulate. Two acquisitions are available:

```python
from core import ActiveLearningLoop, BoxBounds, HighFidelityObservation

bounds = BoxBounds(low=np.array([-1.0, -1.0]), high=np.array([1.0, 1.0]))

def evaluate_hf(theta, *, n_events, seed):
    # Call the real simulator here, then aggregate its event output with CNP.
    beta_bar, y_raw = run_real_simulation_and_aggregate(theta, n_events, seed)
    return HighFidelityObservation(beta_bar=beta_bar, y_raw=y_raw)

loop = ActiveLearningLoop(
    mfgp=mfgp, bounds=bounds, data=data,
    observation_provider=evaluate_hf,
    n_hf_events=128, n_mc_samples=1000, n_candidates_per_axis=50,
    refit_n_restarts=5,
    acquisition="ei",          # or "ivr"
    target="min",              # for EI: 'min' or 'max'
)
records = loop.run(n_steps=5)

for rec in records:
    print(f"step {rec.step}: θ_next={rec.theta_next}  "
          f"IV {rec.integrated_variance_before:.3e} → {rec.integrated_variance_after:.3e}")
```

* `acquisition="ivr"` — pure exploration. Direction-agnostic;
  `target` is ignored at acquisition time.
* `acquisition="ei"` — Expected Improvement, exploitation-leaning.
  `target="max"` searches for an argmax, `target="min"` for an argmin.
  Stars cluster near the predicted optimum once σ shrinks.

### 7. Save / load + revisit results

| Artifact | Save | Load |
|---|---|---|
| Trained CNP | `save_checkpoint(path, cnp, encoder_config, dim_theta, dim_phi, history, metadata)` | `load_checkpoint(path) -> (cnp, payload)` |
| Fitted MFGP | `save_mfgp(path, mfgp)` | `load_mfgp(path) -> MultiFidelityGP` |
| Plots | matplotlib PNGs at user-chosen `out_path` | open with any image viewer |
| Training history | included in CNP checkpoint payload (`payload["history"]`) | read after `load_checkpoint` |

```python
# Reload and revisualize a saved MFGP without re-fitting:
from core import load_mfgp, load_checkpoint
from viz import plot_coverage_test

cnp_reloaded, payload = load_checkpoint("results/cnp.ckpt")
mfgp_reloaded         = load_mfgp("results/mfgp.pkl")

# Run a fresh held-out coverage check using the reloaded models.
result = evaluate_mfgp_coverage_from_batch(
    mfgp_reloaded, cnp_reloaded, fresh_holdout_batch,
)
plot_coverage_test(
    y_raw=result["y_obs"],
    y_predicted=result["mu"],
    sigma_predicted=result["sigma"],
    out_path="results/plots/coverage_replay.png",
    title="MFGP coverage (replay)",
)
```

### Where results go (recommended layout)

The package itself does not impose an output directory — you pass paths
to every save / plot call. We recommend a flat `results/` tree:

```
results/
├── checkpoints/cnp_<run-tag>.ckpt
├── mfgp/mfgp_<run-tag>.pkl
└── plots/
    ├── cnp_only_coverage.png
    ├── mfgp_coverage.png
    └── ...
```

The `viz_output/phaseN_*/` tree is only used by the demonstration
scripts in `scripts/` — it's gitignored.

---

## Run the synthetic-validation pipelines (Phase 1–5)

For a sanity check on a fresh install, the `scripts/` directory drives
the full 8-scenario synthetic validation. All outputs go to
`viz_output/phaseN_*/` (gitignored):

```bash
python scripts/phase1_plot_ground_truth.py        # pseudo-data plots, S1..S8
python scripts/phase2_plot_latent.py              # encoder null-token PCA
python scripts/phase3_plot_reconstruction.py      # CNP train + reconstruction + coverage
python scripts/phase4_plot_mfgp.py                # MFGP posterior + coverage + Q-Q
python scripts/phase5_plot_optimizer.py           # IVR active learning + trajectory
python scripts/phase5_plot_optimizer.py \
    --acquisition ei --target min --n-initial-hf 4 \
    --scenarios S1,S8 \
    --out-dir viz_output/phase5_optimizer/stress_ei_min
```

Every Phase 5 run also emits an `optimizer_{S}_trajectory.png` and an
`optimizer_{S}_metrics.png` showing how the optimizer reaches the optimum.

## Tests

```bash
pytest                     # 158 tests, ~1 minute on CPU
pytest tests/test_cnp_recovery.py  -v   # the 8-scenario MAE gate (~17s)
pytest tests/test_mfgp_recovery.py -v   # MFGP coverage gate, ~2 min
```

## Optical map directly from simulation counts

Run `notebooks/lar_optical_map_binomial_gp.ipynb` with
`config.optical.binomial.yaml` to fit a shared spatial probability function to
simulations with identical physics and different primary counts. This separate
workflow requires the `gp` and `optical-data` extras. It does not use a CNP.

The input is the voxel center `(x, y, z)`; observations are integer hit-producing
primary counts `m` and total primary counts `N`. The backend uses
`m ~ Binomial(N, sigmoid(f(x)))`, a Matérn-5/2 (or RBF) GP plus a constant kernel,
and Laplace inference. Kernel hyperparameters are optimized; their uncertainty
is not integrated. Coordinate scaling uses training data only. LF/HF tags control
splits and reporting, not separate latent functions.

The default uses the current nonzero-only N1500/N5000 folders, all LF voxels and
10 HF voxels for training, and the remaining HF voxels for validation. The full
primary budget enters the likelihood; no context events are removed. Nonzero-only
selection can bias population inference: this is an ordinary binomial likelihood,
not a likelihood conditioned on selecting nonzero files. The loader also supports
zero-hit files if their folders are explicitly added later.

The notebook prepares counts automatically, shows a data-count table, fits the GP,
and saves a checkpoint, configuration, counts, metrics, mean/residual plots and
exact-coordinate predictive coverage under `outputs/optical_binomial/<run>/`.
Predictive intervals use latent logistic-GP draws followed by binomial counts with
each validation voxel's own N. Set `RUN_TRAINING=False` to view saved results.
The existing CNP/MFGP notebook remains a separate workflow.

### Default GP validation metrics

Count-GP and MFGP experiments write a shared set of original-scale, equally
weighted per-voxel scores to their `metrics.json`: mean bias (predicted minus
observed), MAE, RMSE, Pearson/Spearman correlations, descriptive calibration
intercept/slope, CRPS, and weighted interval score. `interval_metrics` contains
nominal probability, inside/total counts, measured coverage, mean width and
interval score at each 1/2/3-sigma-equivalent level. WIS uses the predictive
median, not the mean. Undefined correlations are JSON null. Existing coverage
keys remain compatible. The low-level MFGP coverage evaluator returns these
scores under `metrics` as well.

Likelihood scores describe their measure explicitly: the count GP evaluates
binomial count mass integrated by Monte Carlo over latent probability; MFGP
uses its Gaussian/lognormal predictive density in response units. These NLLs
must not be ranked against each other directly. A lognormal model assigns zero
probability to a zero observation; its nonfinite NLL is saved as null with an
explanation rather than silently clipping the observation. Predictive sampling
uses a fixed seed, and the method/draw count are recorded.

These metrics evaluate held-out observations including counting noise. They do
not establish true latent-rate error or tank-wide population accuracy. Spatial
weighting, regional scores and distance-based validation require a specified
physical evaluation design; no volume weighting is inferred from sparse points.

### Shared spatial projections

`core/spatial_projections.py` implements the integration grid, physical-volume
averages, individual-voxel mixtures, and all x/y/z and xy/xz/yz projections.
`viz/spatial_projections.py` renders the common artifact format. The old MFGP
entry points and `MFGPProjectionConfig` remain compatible aliases/wrappers.
Both approaches use `schemas.projections.ProjectionConfig`.

The count-GP notebook now displays both projection types. Set `RUN_TRAINING=False`
to project a saved run without fitting; YAML `projections.enabled` controls this
step. Saved outputs are `projections/` (latent mean) and
`projections_observed_fraction/` (individual observations), each with curves,
planes, NPZ arrays and metadata. Predictive projections have validation inclusion
counters. They use the saved HF budget when unique; mixed budgets require an
explicit `target_events`. No implicit median budget is substituted.

To add a new GP, implement a projection adapter's `prepare(physical_coordinates)`
method returning an object with `mean`, `metadata`, and `sample(n_draws, rng)`.
The returned array must have shape `(draws, locations)` and preserve joint spatial
correlations. Values are in physical response units, with no observation noise.
The adapter owns coordinate scaling, fidelity selection, and the latent link.
For Gaussian latent posteriors, `GaussianResponse` supports identity, log and
logit links. Other posteriors can supply their own joint-draw implementation.
Register an adapter factory with `register_projection_adapter(name, factory)`;
no integration or plotting code changes are necessary.

```python
from core.projection_adapters import projection_adapter, BinomialObservation
from core.spatial_projections import project_response
from schemas.projections import ProjectionConfig

adapter = projection_adapter("binomial_laplace", fitted_gp)
settings = ProjectionConfig(quantity="observed_fraction", target_events=5000)
arrays, metadata = project_response(
    adapter, physical_training_centers, settings,
    observation_model=BinomialObservation(5000),
)
```

For `latent_mean`, omit the observation model: each joint response draw is
averaged before its quantiles are computed. For `observed_fraction`, the engine
retains omitted-coordinate variation and applies a separate observation model.
Neither built-in adapter includes learned Gaussian observation noise. Invalid
binomial probabilities fail rather than being clipped. Uniform midpoint-cell
weights and dense joint covariance are currently used; grid size is capped to
control memory. To compare models, use the same explicit physical box, grid,
weights, and counting budget. Training convex hulls can differ between datasets.
