## Project Context

**RESUM_FLEX** is a modular refactor of the original RESuM framework (located at `/home/yuema137/resum`, reference paper: [openreview lqTILjL6lP](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=lqTILjL6lP)). RESuM solves the **Rare Event Design (RED)** problem in physics simulations (e.g. NLDBD experiments) where the design metric `y = m/N` is a discrete count with high variance.

The pipeline has three stages:
1. **CNP** denoises discrete counts by reconstructing the underlying Bernoulli parameter `p` (continuous score `β ∈ [0,1]`).
2. **MFGP** (Multi-Fidelity GP, via Emukit + GPy) fuses low-fidelity CNP scores with high-fidelity raw counts to produce a posterior over `y`.
3. **Active Learning** (Integrated Variance Reduction) selects the next design `θ_next`.

### Two kinds of inputs (core architectural distinction)
- `θ` — **design parameters**: global, static per simulation run.
- `φ` — **event parameters**: local stochasticity, unique per event.
- `X` — binary event labels (Bernoulli draws).

Three input modalities must be supported: `FULL (θ,φ,X)`, `EVENT_ONLY (φ,X)`, `DESIGN_ONLY (θ,X)`. Missing components are handled via a **Universal Encoder with learnable null embeddings** (`theta_null`, `phi_null`) — not by branching code paths.

### Module layout & contracts
| File | Role | Key I/O |
|---|---|---|
| `core/data_engine.py` | Standardize raw sim files → `StandardBatch` | `theta:[B,Dθ]?`, `phi:[B,N,Dφ]?`, `labels:[B,N,1]`, `masks` |
| `core/networks.py` | Dual-Latent Encoder w/ null handling | → `z_θ:[B,Z]`, `z_φ:[B,N,Z]` |
| `core/surrogate_cnp.py` | Event-level CNP, reconstructs `p` | → `BetaScore:[B,N,1]` |
| `core/surrogate_mfgp.py` | Design-level MFGP (Emukit/GPy) | → `(μ_θ, σ²_θ)` |
| `core/optimizer.py` | IVR active learning loop | → `NextTheta` |
| `schemas/data_models.py` | pydantic schemas: `DesignPoint`, `EventBatch`, `StandardBatch`, `ModelPrediction` | — |

### Hard decoupling rules
- `core/networks.py` (PyTorch) MUST NOT import `core/surrogate_mfgp.py` (GPy/Emukit). The two stacks stay separate.
- The encoder must be swappable (MLP ↔ Transformer) without changes to `data_engine`.
- All active hyperparameters live in `config.yaml` and are loaded via pydantic;
  deferred features are not exposed as inert configuration fields.
- `StandardBatch.theta` and `StandardBatch.phi` are `Optional`; presence is communicated via boolean masks.

### Environment and dependency ownership
- `pyproject.toml` is the sole Python dependency declaration; never copy its
  package list into `pixi.toml`.
- uv owns Python resolution and `uv.lock`. Its mutually exclusive `numpy1` and
  `numpy2` groups validate the published `numpy>=1.24,<3` range in separate
  `.venv-numpy1` and `.venv-numpy2` environments.
- Pixi owns only the external `uv` executable, task orchestration, and
  `pixi.lock`. Every Python-running Pixi task delegates to `uv --frozen`.
- The development matrix pins CPU Torch 2.11.0 in both environments to isolate
  NumPy-stack differences; published metadata remains `torch>=2.3` and
  backend-neutral.
- The supported Python window is 3.11–3.12 so both NumPy 1.26 and NumPy 2 can
  be exercised. `gp` selects GPy 1.14.2+ for NumPy 2; the mutually exclusive
  `gp-numpy1` extra preserves GPy 1.13.2 only for the legacy compatibility job.
- The full NumPy 2 GP stack requires Python 3.11+, SciPy 1.13+, Matplotlib
  3.9+, PyTorch 2.3+, GPy 1.14.2+, and Emukit 0.5.1+.
- Pin NumPy 2 tests to one BLAS thread to prevent severe oversubscription on
  small GP matrices. Pin the legacy NumPy 1 test to two threads to preserve its
  established deterministic optimizer path.

### Input scaling (do not skip on real data)
- The CNP encoder is a vanilla MLP; gradient imbalance makes it **scale-blind** when θ or φ components differ in magnitude by ≥ ~10×. The MFGP can compensate via ARD lengthscales, the CNP cannot.
- Recommended workflow on real (non-uniform-sampled) data: normalize via `core.scaling.MinMaxScaler` (`from_bounds(low, high)` if known, `fit(X)` otherwise) **before** building the `StandardBatch`. Persist the scaler alongside CNP / MFGP checkpoints so predictions can be inverse-transformed back to physical units.
- `StandardBatch._check_consistency` emits a `ScaleImbalanceWarning` when per-feature ranges differ by more than `SCALE_IMBALANCE_THRESHOLD` (default 10×). Detection only — the framework does not auto-scale, since silent unit changes would surprise users querying back at predict time.

### Status
First task is to define `schemas/data_models.py`. No code exists yet beyond this CLAUDE.md.

## Validation Matrix (Combinatorial Dimension Test)

The refactor must pass an 8-scenario test grid that combines input mode × θ-dim × φ-dim. Every module's I/O contract is verified against this grid; visual outputs are part of acceptance, not optional.

| ID | Mode | dim(θ) | dim(φ) | Visualization required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | FULL | 1 | 1 | 2D heatmap (x=θ, y=φ) |
| S2 | FULL | 2 | 1 | 3D slices or multi-subplot |
| S3 | FULL | 1 | 2 | 3D slices or multi-subplot |
| S4 | FULL | 2 | 2 | dim-reduced projection plots |
| S5 | EVENT_ONLY | — | 1 | 1D curve |
| S6 | EVENT_ONLY | — | 2 | 2D heatmap |
| S7 | DESIGN_ONLY | 1 | — | 1D curve |
| S8 | DESIGN_ONLY | 2 | — | 2D heatmap |

### Plot dispatch rule
- `dim == 1` → line plot with mean ± variance band.
- `dim == 2` → contour plot or heatmap.
- `dim ≥ 3` → projection / sliced subplots.

This rule lives in a single utility (`viz/dispatch.py` or similar) — modules call it; they do not branch on dim themselves.

### Acceptance criterion (per scenario)
`MAE(predicted_β, ground_truth_p) < threshold` on held-out points from the pseudo-data generator. Threshold lives in `config.yaml` per scenario (looser tolerance for higher-dim cases is expected).

## Visualization & Validation Plan

**Strict progression rule:** no phase advances until its plots match the physical expectation. Every phase emits artifacts to its own `viz_output/phaseN_*/` subfolder (`phase1_ground_truth/`, `phase2_encoder/`, `phase3_cnp/`, `phase4_mfgp/`, `phase5_optimizer/`) and they are reviewed before the next phase starts.

### Comparison rule (when a prediction exists)

Whenever a downstream module (CNP, MFGP) produces a prediction over the same input space as the analytical ground truth, the plot **must place ground truth and prediction together** so the eye can do a direct comparison:

- **1D fields** → both curves on the **same axes** (overlay): analytical `t(·)` and the predicted curve (`β`, MFGP `μ`, …). Keep the binary `X` scatter underneath so the noise context is visible.
- **2D fields** → **side-by-side subplots** with a **shared colorbar**: left = ground truth, right = prediction (or empirical estimate). Same `vmin/vmax` so a darker spot on the right is darker for the right reason.
- **3D / 4D fields** (S2, S3, S4) → same layout as 2D, but the prediction subplot uses a **thin-slab projection**: keep only samples whose un-shown coordinate(s) fall within `±ε` of the slice value, then bin on the visible grid. Increase sample count to keep slab bins populated; the comparison is qualitative (shape & peak agreement), not pixel-exact.

Phase 1 is **ground-truth-only** — nothing to compare against yet, so the current plots stay as the reference baseline. The comparison rule activates from Phase 3 onward.

### Phase 1 — Pseudo-data ground truth
File(s): `viz_output/phase1_ground_truth/pseudo_ground_truth_S{1..8}.png`
- 1D θ or 1D φ → smooth `p(·)` curve, overlay the binary `X` samples to show how rare events cluster around the peak.
- 2D inputs → heatmap of `p(·, ·)`.
- Cross-check: in `EVENT_ONLY`, plot must vary over φ but stay flat against any dummy θ; mirror in `DESIGN_ONLY`.
- Pass: plot resembles the intended analytical function (Gaussian hump, sine, etc.).

### Phase 2 — Encoder null embedding
File(s): `viz_output/phase2_encoder/encoder_latent_S1_vs_S5.png`, `viz_output/phase2_encoder/encoder_shape_table.txt`
- PCA / t-SNE of `z_θ` for S1 (θ provided) vs S5 (θ=None).
- Hard requirement: every `None` input maps to the **exact same** learnable null-token vector — the S5 cluster must collapse to a single point.
- Pass: all 8 scenarios flow through without shape mismatch; null cluster is a singleton.

### Phase 3 — CNP reconstruction (the critical denoising test)
File(s): `viz_output/phase3_cnp/cnp_reconstruction_S{1..8}.png`, `viz_output/phase3_cnp/cnp_coverage_S{1..8}.png`, `viz_output/phase3_cnp/cnp_reconstruction_{S1,S3}_theta.png`
Apply the **comparison rule** in every panel:
- 1D scenarios (S5, S7): overlay analytical `p(·)` and predicted `β(·)` on the same axes; binary `X` scatter underneath.
- 2D scenarios (S1, S6, S8): side-by-side heatmaps `[ground-truth p | predicted β]`, shared colorbar.
- 3D/4D scenarios (S2, S3, S4): same side-by-side layout, but the predicted-β panel is computed on the same slice axes used by Phase 1.
- Pass: `MAE(β, p) < threshold[scenario]` from `config.yaml` AND peaks of predicted β align with peaks of ground-truth p.

### Phase 4 — MFGP fidelity fusion
File(s): `viz_output/phase4_mfgp/mfgp_posterior_S{1..8}.png`, `viz_output/phase4_mfgp/mfgp_coverage_S{1..8}.png`, `viz_output/phase4_mfgp/mfgp_qq.png`
Apply the **comparison rule**:
- 1D θ: scatter raw `y_Raw^HF`, curve `y_CNP^LF`, **and** the analytical `t̄(θ)` from the pseudo-data generator, all overlaid; posterior mean `μ` as a solid line with `±σ` shaded band on the same axes. The analytical truth is the visual yardstick — `μ` should hug it where data exists.
- 2D θ: side-by-side heatmaps `[analytical t̄ | MFGP μ]`, shared colorbar; a third panel for `σ` (uncertainty map) is welcome.
- Calibration: QQ-plot or residual histogram on a held-out HF set.
- Pass: σ band narrow near HF points, wider in gaps; numerical coverage on holdout approaches 68 / 95 / 99.7%.

### Phase 5 — IVR optimizer
File(s) per scenario in `viz_output/phase5_optimizer/`:
- `optimizer_{S}_step{1..N}.png` — per-step σ + acquisition surfaces.
- `optimizer_{S}_iv.png` — integrated-variance trace across AL steps.
- `optimizer_{S}_trajectory.png` — final-state search history: t̄(θ), MFGP μ(θ) ± σ, initial HF (gray dots), 5 AL steps as numbered red stars, vertical markers at the true and predicted optima.
- `optimizer_{S}_metrics.png` — per-step optimization gap |θ_true − θ_pred| and surrogate MAE(μ, t̄).

Annotations:
- 2D θ: side-by-side heatmaps of posterior σ(θ) and the IVR acquisition surface; cyan X marks the true optimum, orange diamond marks the predicted optimum.
- 1D θ: side-by-side line plots of σ(θ) (with analytical t̄(θ) overlaid) and acquisition; vertical dotted blue line at true argmax/argmin, red dot-dash line at predicted argmax/argmin.
- Overlay all previously-sampled θ as dots, the next θ as a red star.

Optimization target (max vs min) is a CLI flag `--target {max,min}` (default `max` since our Gaussian-bump truths peak at `θ_peak`). IVR itself is direction-agnostic; the flag only changes how the true / predicted optimum is highlighted and reported.

Pass criteria:
- Posterior σ band shrinks across Θ as steps accumulate (qualitative).
- Integrated posterior variance trends downward (∫σ²-trace plot).
- Surrogate MAE(μ, t̄) decreases over the AL run; gap |θ_true − θ_pred| does not blow up.
- Cross-check: AL stars either cluster near the true optimum (exploitation) or systematically reduce MAE / gap by exploring the gaps in σ (pure-exploration behavior of IVR).

| Phase | Output file | What to look for |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `pseudo_ground_truth_*.png` | Probability map looks physical |
| 3 | `cnp_reconstruction_S{1..8}.png` | Predicted β tracks ground-truth p |
| 4 | `mfgp_posterior_1d.png`, `mfgp_qq.png` | μ goes through data; σ realistic; coverage 68/95/99.7% |
| 5 | `optimizer_{S}_step*.png`, `optimizer_{S}_iv.png` | Red star in high-σ region; integrated variance shrinks across steps |

## Phased Implementation Plan

Phases run in order. Each phase has a hard acceptance gate before the next begins.

> **Numbering note.** An earlier project brief bundled Encoder + CNP into one "Phase 2 — CNP Training". We split it: our Phase 2 is the universal encoder alone, our Phase 3 is the CNP. The split exists so the encoder's null-embedding identity gate (which has a bit-for-bit pass criterion) doesn't get tangled with CNP training noise. Downstream phases (MFGP, Optimizer) shift to 4 and 5 accordingly.

### Phase 0 — Schemas (`schemas/data_models.py`)
- Define `DesignPoint`, `EventBatch`, `StandardBatch`, `ModelPrediction` as pydantic models.
- `StandardBatch.theta` and `StandardBatch.phi` are `Optional`; presence carried by mask flags.
- Tensor shape validators allow arbitrary `dim(θ)` and `dim(φ)`.
- **Gate:** instantiate empty/null/full `StandardBatch` for all 8 scenarios without errors.

### Phase 1 — Pseudo-Data Generator (`data/pseudo_generator.py`)
- `PseudoDataGenerator.generate(mode, dim_theta, dim_phi, n_trials, n_events) → StandardBatch`.
- Internally defines a known ground-truth `t(θ,φ)` (e.g. a smooth function with a localized peak); samples `X ~ Bernoulli(t(θ,φ))`.
- Returns both the `StandardBatch` and the analytical `t(θ,φ)` ground truth (for later validation).
- **Gate:** for all 8 scenarios, plot ground-truth `p` using the dim-dispatch rule; verify `X` is a Bernoulli noisy realization of `p`.

### Phase 2 — Universal Encoder (`core/networks.py`)
- Implements learnable `theta_null` and `phi_null` parameters.
- Forward pass returns `z_θ:[B,Z]` and `z_φ:[B,N,Z]` regardless of which inputs were `None`.
- **Gate (Dimension Test):** print output shapes for S1–S8; all `[B,Z]` / `[B,N,Z]` aligned. **Gate (Null Test):** `theta=None` and `phi=None` paths execute without error and produce non-NaN tensors.

### Phase 3 — CNP (`core/surrogate_cnp.py`)
- Train CNP on pseudo-data; recover continuous `β ≈ p`.
- **Training paradigm — context-target split (meta-learning).** Each simulation batch is partitioned per-step into a *context* set (the encoder + aggregator sees these) and a *target* set (the decoder predicts on these). `n_context` is sampled in `[n_context_min, n_context_max]` from `config.cnp`. The model learns to summarize an arbitrary context into a representation that makes the target predictable.
- **Loss has two explicit contracts.** `theory-truth` (default) optimizes the
  marginalized Bernoulli likelihood; `practice-truth` reproduces the legacy
  `sigmoid_expectation` + Normal `log_prob` implementation.
- **Aggregator axis — reduce over `N`, NEVER over `B`.** The aggregator collapses the per-event latents `[B, N_ctx, Z]` into a per-trial summary `[B, Z]` by taking the mean along the *event* axis. Reducing over the batch axis would mix unrelated trials and silently break learning. (See "Implementation gotchas" in the Math section.)
- **Gate (1D):** for 1D θ or φ, regression curve must pass through the dense center of the binary `X` cloud.
- **Gate (2D):** for 2D inputs, predicted `β` heatmap "peaks" must align with ground-truth `p` heatmap peaks.
- **Quantitative gate:** `MAE(β, p) < threshold` per scenario from `config.yaml`.
- **Plot:** apply the comparison rule (1D overlay; 2D side-by-side with shared colorbar) — see Visualization section.

### Phase 4 — MFGP (`core/surrogate_mfgp.py`)
- **MFGP input is `θ` only — `φ` is marginalized out.** The aggregated CNP score `β̄(θ_k) = (1/N) Σ_i β_ki` is what the GP sees; per-event randomness is collapsed before this layer. Three fidelity datasets feed in (`β̄^LF`, `β̄^HF`, `y_Raw^HF`), all keyed by `θ`.
- Co-kriging via Emukit/GPy, parameterized over arbitrary `dim(θ)`.
- **Gate (1D θ):** plot posterior mean with shaded confidence band.
- **Gate (2D θ):** plot 3D response surface.
- **Gate (coverage):** on held-out HF samples, ±1σ/±2σ/±3σ coverage approaches 68/95/99.7%.

### Phase 5 — IVR Optimizer (`core/optimizer.py`)
- IVR acquisition with constraint penalties; gradient-based selection of `θ_next`.
- Canonical demonstration: a **5-step active-learning loop** that picks `θ_next` from the trained MFGP, re-evaluates the truth at that point, retrains, repeats.
- Visualize uncertainty reduction across iterations (see Phase 5 viz spec).
- Final phase; out of scope until Phase 4 coverage gate is green.

### Cross-cutting

- [x] User-facing README (separate from CLAUDE.md, which is the agent brief)

### Deferred decisions

- **Mixup augmentation** (originally Phase 3). Skipped on synthetic data because our `t_max≈0.4` setup gives ~10–30 % positives — nothing like the paper's ~1:5·10⁴ imbalance — and all 8 scenarios already converge to MAE 0.002–0.021 vs thresholds 0.05–0.12 without it. Implementing it cleanly requires either continuous labels in `StandardBatch` (breaks Phase 0 contract) or a separate tensor-level loss path. Re-open when wiring real LEGEND data: `core/training.py`'s step is the integration point.

## Math & Concepts (load-bearing for implementation)

These are the formulas that pin down loss functions, output shapes, and validation criteria. Anchors against drift.

### RED problem setup
- Per event `i` in trial `k`: `X_ki ∈ {0,1}` is a Bernoulli draw with `p = t(θ_k, φ_ki)`.
- Trial-level count: `m = Σ_i X_i`. Raw design metric: `y_Raw = m/N`.
- True objective (what we actually want to minimize): the **marginalized triggering rate**
  `t̄(θ) = ∫ t(θ, φ) g(φ) dφ`, where `g(φ)` is the event-parameter distribution.
- Optimization target: `θ* = argmin_{θ ∈ Θ} t̄(θ)`.
- Rare-event regime: `m ≪ N`, so `m ~ Poisson(N·t̄(θ))`. At small `N`, `y` lives on a discrete grid `{0/N, 1/N, …}` with high variance — this is *why* a surrogate is needed.

### CNP (event-level)
- Replaces binary `X_ki` with a continuous score `β_ki ≈ t(θ_k, φ_ki) ∈ [0,1]`.
- Bayesian view: CNP is a VAE-like estimator of the latent function `t(θ,φ)`. The "decoder" is the *predefined* Bernoulli; the "encoder" `q_NN` is what we train.
  `q_NN(t(θ,φ)) = N(μ_NN(θ,φ;w), σ²_NN(θ,φ;w))` conditioned on `{X_ki, φ_ki, θ_k}`.
- Both objectives share the legacy logistic-normal moment transform, producing
  `(p̄, s̄) = resum_binary_moments(out)`.
- **Theory-truth:** `-Σ[X log p̄ + (1-X) log(1-p̄)]`. For binary `X`, this
  equals the negative log marginalized Bernoulli likelihood because
  `∫ Bernoulli(X|p)q(p)dp` depends only on `E_q[p]=p̄`.
- **Practice-truth:** `-Σ log Normal(X|p̄,s̄)`. This is the literal legacy
  runtime behavior; it is available for reproducibility, not as the default
  probability model.
- Architecture: `encoder (MLP) → mean-aggregator → decoder`. Context point = concat(θ, φ_i, X_i). β output bounded to `[0,1]` (sigmoid or equivalent).
- `β_ki` is **fidelity-invariant** by construction — it depends only on `(θ, φ)`, so the same CNP applies to LF and HF events.

### Aggregated CNP score (trial-level)
Per simulation trial:
`y_CNP(θ_k) = (1/N) Σ_{i=1..N} β_ki`

### MFGP (trial-level, three fidelities)
Three input metrics into the GP, all keyed by `θ`:
1. `y_CNP^LF` — averaged β over LF events (cheap, broad coverage).
2. `y_CNP^HF` — averaged β over HF events.
3. `y_Raw^HF` — `m/N` from HF (the ultimate target).

**Co-kriging recursion** (Kennedy–O'Hagan):
`f_H(θ) = ρ · f_L(θ) + δ(θ)`, with `δ ~ GP` and scalar `ρ`. Joint covariance:
`Σ = [[K_LL,        ρ·K_LL          ],
      [ρ·K_LL,      ρ²·K_LL + K_δ   ]]`
Recurses for >2 levels: `f_{H_i}(θ) = ρ_i · f_{L_i}(θ) + δ_i(θ)`.

GP posterior at `θ*`:
`μ* = K(θ*, Θ) K(Θ,Θ)⁻¹ y`
`σ²* = K(θ*, θ*) − K(θ*, Θ) K(Θ,Θ)⁻¹ K(Θ, θ*)`

### Active Learning — Integrated Variance Reduction (IVR)
Pick next design point by minimizing expected total posterior variance:
`I(θ_new) = ∫_Θ σ²(θ | θ_new) dθ`,  `θ_new = argmin_θ I(θ)`.

Tractable approximation (RBF kernel, MC sample of `θ_i`):
`I(θ) ≈ (1/N) Σ_i k²(θ_i, θ) / σ²(θ)`.
Constraints on Θ are enforced via penalty terms that drive the acquisition to zero in infeasible regions.

### Class imbalance & mixup
- Signal:background ratio in raw events is ~`1 : 5·10⁴`. Without augmentation, CNP collapses.
- **Mixup** augmentation: draw `λ ~ Beta(α, α)` with `α = 0.1` (paper value):
  `x̂ = λ·x_i + (1−λ)·x_j`,  `ŷ = λ·y_i + (1−λ)·y_j`.
  `α` lives in config.

### Validation / coverage criterion
A trained MFGP is "good" if its predictive band covers held-out HF samples at standard-normal rates:
- 1σ → ≈68.27% (paper achieved 69%)
- 2σ → ≈95.45% (paper achieved 95%)
- 3σ → ≈99.73% (paper achieved 100%)

This is the project's gold-standard test. The ablation without `y_CNP` got 12% / 24% / 47% — **dropping the CNP scores breaks the model**, this is the empirical justification for the three-fidelity design.

### Implementation gotchas these formulas imply
- CNP output activation must keep `β ∈ [0,1]` — `μ_NN` should be passed through sigmoid (or use a bounded distribution).
- Keep both CNP objectives separately tested: theory-truth against the
  marginalized Bernoulli formula, practice-truth against the legacy Normal
  `log_prob` implementation. Never silently alias one to the other.
- **Aggregator axis (CRITICAL):** the CNP aggregator reduces along the **event axis `N`**, *never* along the **batch axis `B`**. Latents `[B, N_ctx, Z]` collapse to `[B, Z]` via `mean(dim=1)` (not `dim=0`). Reducing over `B` mixes unrelated trials and destroys learning silently — the loss still goes down, the predictions are garbage. Add an explicit `assert` on the aggregated tensor's first dim.
- MFGP must accept `(θ_k, y_CNP^LF_k)`, `(θ_k, y_CNP^HF_k)`, `(θ_k, y_Raw^HF_k)` as three separate fidelity datasets, not stacked — Emukit's API handles this explicitly.
- IVR acquisition needs to evaluate the GP posterior fast and many times — keep the GP backend (GPy) hot, don't re-instantiate per call.

## Tooling

- **Configuration**: `pydantic` + `pydantic-yaml`. Every config object is a `pydantic.BaseModel`; YAML files load into and validate against these models.
- **Testing**: `pytest`. Each module should have a corresponding test file. Aim to test pure logic without requiring real HDF5 access where possible (use small synthetic fixtures).
- **Lint + format**: `ruff` (both `ruff check` and `ruff format`).
- **Type checking**: not enforced for now; revisit if the project grows.
- **Experiment tracking**: TBD. Decide before the first real training run.

## Coding Standards

- **Logic First**: Before every modification, review the current structure of the whole project and consider whether the structure itself is appropriate, rather than just bolting on the desired feature. Keep the code clean and elegant.
- **Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast**: Never be greedy when adding a feature or refactoring. Fix the bug first, then improve structure. Focus on the current problem at each step; do not over-optimize.
- **Clear docstrings and comments**: write correct types for inputs and outputs. `pydantic` validation and informative error messages are strongly encouraged for every function and class.
- **Avoid deep coupling between modules**: each module should be testable in isolation, pluggable, and decoupled.
- **Always think about what test we can add for each single module**: pytest is powerful — use it.
- **Be humble and curious**: if you are unsure about something — feature details, data format, intent — do not guess. Ask the user explicitly.
- **Be strict with the user and double-check**: what the user says is not always correct. If a statement seems wrong or an idea seems impractical, ask for clarification and state the objection clearly.
- **Never directly continue right after conversation compression**: stop after compression. The user will re-supply the context, docs, and code to read. Do not start blindly.
- **Always check the detailed code** if you are not sure about something, if you cannot find the answer from the code, then ask me. don't guess, but check and ask.
- **Always update the design doc (CLAUDE.md for this project)**, with implementation details and mark the completed bullet points. and record the test results when the tests are done. you don't need to wait until a full commit is finished. you can update more frequently once a bullet point is finished.

## Integrated event-surrogate and optical workflow

- Use `python -m core.surrogates train CONFIG.yaml` for all current workflows.
  See docs/surrogates.md for model alternatives. The only retained run config,
  config.optical.resum.yaml, runs legacy CNP -> MFGP. Tests use temporary configs.
- Core modules, schemas, data preparation, evaluation, checkpoints and tests are
  integrated. Experiments must not introduce separate model-specific scripts.
- Sampling: natural, corrected positive quota, and class-aware mixup. Mixup uses
  fresh disjoint source pools each batch and independent pair weights. Context
  may be real or mixed; both mixture parents remain on the same source side.
- Training objective: single (default) or optional real_plus_mixup with separately
  averaged losses, one optimizer update, explicit loss weight and target ratio.
  Legacy two-output losses are explicit theory-truth or practice-truth. Legacy
  scale is preserved separately and is not treated as calibrated uncertainty.
- MFGP optional stage fits LF means, HF means and HF raw fractions using training
  voxels only. Predictive variance includes fitted GP observation noise. Existing
  viz.dispatch.plot_coverage_test renders coverage; do not duplicate it.
- Completed optical run: outputs/optical_resum/legacy_mixup_context/seed0.
  Legacy CNP theory-truth, standard mixup, mixed context, best step9000/10000.
  HF MFGP mean .00214950 vs observed .00206645, MAE .000757885, r .893889.
  Coverage 8/10 at1sigma,10/10 at2sigma. Two negative Gaussian GP means retained.
  Outputs/checkpoints are preserved locally; no test files used.
- User workflow: commit and push verified integrated changes regularly to origin
  (the fork). Exclude experimental notebooks/scripts and generated outputs.
- Cleanup: removed assistant-generated experiment scripts/notebooks and obsolete
  one-off configs. Original tracked examples and integrated unit tests remain.
  Data preparation is available through data.prepare_optical_data; document its
  library API rather than resurrecting a separate preparation script.

## Run configuration cleanup

- Only config.optical.resum.yaml is retained. Removed other standalone run
  configurations, including the historical notebook minimal config.
- Updated active docs/CLI and made legacy schema/recovery tests use a temporary
  fixture instead of deleted example files; transformer test uses schema defaults.
- Validation: 64 schema, optical-data, and transformer tests passed; retained
  config validates as legacy_cnp, theory-truth, mixed context, full MFGP stage.

## Maintained LAr optical-map notebook

- User explicitly requested one notebook: notebooks/lar_optical_map.ipynb.
  Uses shared run_experiment, config.optical.resum.yaml and standard plot outputs.
- Run All trains by default into a new timestamped folder. Existing-results mode
  reports saved settings; loss override supports both legacy objectives.
- Includes data checks, training, CNP/GP metrics, original coverage plots, optical
  map and reloaded-model query example. No duplicated training or plotting code.
- Validation: notebook format validated; every code cell executed with a two-step
  CNP / one-restart GP smoke run, then again in saved-results mode. Plot paths and
  reloaded GP predictions verified. Full 10,000-step defaults remain unchanged.

## Optical notebook simplification

- Reduced executable notebook code from 142 to 78 lines. Read experiment settings
  directly from the optical YAML; removed redundant overrides, data-count table,
  timing boilerplate and optional checkpoint/query demo. Retained LF checks,
  saved configuration, metrics, sampling audit and every plot.
- Verified identical resolved training settings (except fresh output paths) for
  both default and Gaussian loss. Executed all revised cells in training and
  saved-run modes against existing smoke artifacts, stubbing the unchanged
  run_experiment call; no new full training was needed.

- Reframed the notebook around population-level LAr optical-map emulation and
  renamed it lar_optical_map.ipynb. Removed legacy wording from notebook prose;
  verified every executable cell is unchanged and notebook format validates.

## Non-zero-hit HF split with ten modeling voxels

- User requested excluding zero-hit HF, then 10 HF modeling voxels and all other
  retained HF voxels for validation. Prepared a new dataset at
  outputs/optical_data_lf1500_hf10_nonzero using existing prepare_optical_data.
- Excluded 9 of 65 HF files. Selected 10 of 56 non-zero-hit HF files uniformly
  without replacement from sorted filenames with numpy default_rng(42); remaining
  46 are validation, including former HF test files. No HF test partition remains.
- LF assignments remain 111/24/24. Refit normalization using precisely 111 LF +
  10 HF training files. Saved config, split manifest, exclusions and selection
  provenance with the new dataset; old data and results retained.
- Updated optical config and notebook checks/descriptions. Cleared stale notebook
  execution outputs after changing datasets; preserved unrelated local prose.
- Validation: notebook data cells passed; saved LF assignments unchanged and
  normalization fit-file membership verified. Two-step CNP / one-restart GP smoke
  run passed, producing 10 HF GP training rows and 46 HF validation predictions
  with coverage plots. Full training has not been rerun for this split.

## All-LF training experiment

- User requested all LF voxels for training, skipping LF validation. Interpret as
  all 159 retained non-zero-hit LF voxels (including former LF test); zero-hit
  filtering remains in force. HF assignments stay exactly 10 training / 46 validation.
- New prepared dataset outputs/optical_data_alllf_hf10_nonzero, saved manifest and
  policy; normalization refitted on training only. Previous dataset retained.
- Added lf_validation run flag (default true); optical config sets false. Shared
  workflow skips LF validation input/evaluation/GP diagnostics and uses final CNP
  checkpoint via existing no-validation trainer behavior. HF is never used for
  CNP checkpoint selection. Training history and LF training PR remain visible.
- Updated notebook and regression test to cover absent LF validation data.
- Validation: 121 surrogate/legacy/MFGP regression cases passed, including both
  LF-validation modes. All notebook code cells passed a two-step CNP / one-restart
  GP smoke run; HF predictions were finite and coverage plots generated. GPy
  emitted numerical warnings during smoke optimization but completed. Full
  10,000-step training has not been rerun for this test configuration.


## Retired combined-LF approaches

- User requested LF1500 only. Removed grouped LF training/preparation support,
  separate LF event-count GP levels, their tests, and both combined-LF notebook
  copies. Restored the shared modules and config to the verified LF1500 workflow.
- Retained all 159 non-zero-hit LF1500 voxels for training, no LF validation,
  10 HF modeling / 46 HF validation, mixed-context two-output CNP, and three GP
  levels. Original simulation files and historical result artifacts are untouched.
- Main notebook preserves local prose changes, requires 1500-event LF input,
  clears stale outputs and selects saved runs only from the configured LF dataset.
- Validation: optical/surrogate/legacy/MFGP regression suite passed; main notebook
  setup/data checks and all display-only cells passed against the saved LF1500
  run. Repository search found no active pooled/event-count LF workflow references.


## Raw input views and folder lists

- Created data/lar_optical_map/lf1500_hf_nonzero (159 LF1500 + 56 HF) and
  lf1500_hf_all (224 LF1500 + 65 HF), each with lf/hf symlinks and a manifest.
  Seven errored HF one-primary files are excluded and recorded; originals intact.
- User clarified configuration should accept multiple folders. Added
  SourceConfig.directories mapping lf/hf to folder lists, mutually exclusive with
  the original single directory root. Loader resolves relative YAML paths.
- Reader assigns fidelity explicitly for arbitrary folder names, deduplicates
  symlink/physical-file repeats, rejects conflicting fidelity or filename identities.
  Homogeneous event-count requirement remains; no combined-statistics approach restored.
- New config.optical.data.yaml points to non-zero input folders and the existing
  LF1500/HF10 split manifest. Training config/data and notebook remain unchanged.
- Validation: 21 optical tests passed, including folder lists, duplicate handling,
  ambiguous sources and relative-path resolution. Real configured sources read
  successfully and match all 215 existing manifest records and split assignments.
